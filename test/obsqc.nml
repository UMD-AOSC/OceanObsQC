&qc_depths
  !! Check for proper monotonically increasing depths, with sufficient levels.
  !! A profile is removed if any of the following checks fail.

  check_nonmono=T   ! check to ensure depth values increase monotonically

  ! NOTE: setting any of the following to negative will disable that
  !  individual test

  min_levels=3      ! minimum number of vertical levels required
  max_depth=6000.0  ! maximum depth allowed (meters)
  max_start=-1      ! first level must be above this depth (meters)
  max_gap=500.0     ! no vertical gaps larger than this allowed (meters)
/



&qc_gross
  !! Check for gross errors on the profile date, time, position, and values.
  !! If any of the checks fail, the entire profile is removed.

  remove_zero_latlon = T    ! remove if lat==0 and lon==0
  t_max = 33.0              ! maximum temperature value (C)
  t_min = -4.0              ! minimum temperature value (C)

  s_min = 0.1               ! minimum salinity value (PSU)

  !! check temperature and salinity profile against a pre-computed mean and
  !! standard deviation climatology file.

  clim_file_salt="salt"      ! name of monthly salinity mean in clim file
  clim_file_salt_sd="ssdv"   ! name of monthly salinity stddev in clim file

  ocean_searchdist=150.0e3   ! maximum distance (m) to search for a matching
                             ! ocean gridpoint in the clim file.
